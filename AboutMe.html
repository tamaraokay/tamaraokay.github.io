    <p> Hello
        My name is Tamara Ili Okay, I am originally from Brisbane Australia but was raised in Sydney. Moved from Australia when I was about 8 years old to Samoa, spent about a year and then moved to this lovely country New Zealand, now I am currently living in Glen Innes, Auckland New Zealand. I have 2 sisters and 1 brother, I live with my parents and my 2 sisters, and my older brother he lives in Samoa with my grandma. I believe that everything is possible if you have GOD and FAMILY with you, because with their unconditionally love, you'll feel loved every day, of every month ,of every year! </p>

    <p> I am a outgoing kind of girl that is trustworthy and loyal to her friends and family. I have 3 bestfriends that I consider sisters, their names are Auvaa, Vonny and Ricki, to be honest I will cherish every moment with them because I don't know what the future will bring. My friends are outrageous and funny at the same time, we like to take risks sometimes because its just the way to live life. I shall cherish every moment with these beauts, like theirs no tomorrow! </p>
